# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

This project is the first of the Udacity **Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree**. The goal is to train an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Requirements

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

2. Unzip (or decompress) the downloaded file in the current folder.

3. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

<code>Linux or Mac:
conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
source activate drlnd</code>

<code>Windows:
conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
activate drlnd</code>

4. Navigate to the *Python/* subfolder that you will find inside the current folder and run <code>pip install .</code> to install dependencies.

5. Edit the first cell of the *training_and_observation.ipynb* to specify the appropriate path to the Unity ML environment.
